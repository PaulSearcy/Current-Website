Welcome to the React + Typescript rewrite of my website psearcy.com

The goal is to use Typescript as a way to quickly debug common runtime issues at compile time.
Since I'm not an expert at JSX or React syntax, Typescript is a great way to catch a lot of the early mistakes I will be making.

Also, I really need to learn Typescript as I deal with types all the time in C# and this smooths over the differences in syntactic sugar between C# and JS.

The plan is to use React, React-DOM, React-Bootstrap, React-Router, and inline CSS (JSX format)
to create a rudimentary replica of the current site feel.

This readme is also rudimentary and will be updated as I absorb more knowledge relating to React and other modules.
