# PSEARCY.COM -- Website Rewrite and Current State

Welcome to the rewrite of my website psearcy.com

I recently decided to take apart the [previous](https://github.com/tridon777/Old-Website) version of my website and rewrite it using Typescript + React. 

##Rationale 

Over the past year working with Node I've been continously working with new JS libraries on side projects that were very experimental in nature. In that time span experimenting I revisited the interesting concept of [Functional Programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming) that I had struggled conceptualizing in college. 

After successfully implementing a variety of formulas functionally using a JS library [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.22.1/index.html). I wanted a way to apply such reasoning to a real world example which lead me on to the front end framework [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). (Which its syntax reminded me of how Swift was doing things with each view) 

Cocurrently in my day job, during the majority of this period, I was writing in the strongly typed language C#. Working formally in a language know I got to see how having types provided a way of displaying information about what data your passing around and the ways it might be used. In general it made code that much easier to understand because from the types you could infer partially the inentions and assumptions from the previous iteration of development. 

I wanted to bring all these pieces together into a cohesive project and see how it turned out. I think it turned out pretty well, now I just need to refactor! 

## Future Development

I play to rewrite this again, content staying the same, in Vue JS 2.0 to explore combining templating with reacts modularity and functional focus. Think Handlebars, plus React.
