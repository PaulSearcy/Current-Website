# PSEARCY.COM -- Website Rewrite and Current State

Welcome to the rewrite of my website psearcy.com

I recently decided to take apart the [previous](https://github.com/tridon777/Old-Website) version of my website and rewrite it using Typescript + React. 

##Rationale 

Over the past year working with Node I've been continously working with new JS libraries on side projects that were very experimental in nature. In that time span experimenting I revisited the interesting concept of [Functional Programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming) that I had struggled conceptualizing in college. 

After successfully implementing a variety of formulas functionally using a JS library [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.22.1/index.html). I wanted a way to apply such reasoning to a real world example which lead me on to the front end framework [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). 

Cocurrently in my day job, during the majority of this period, I was writing in the strongly typed language C#.
